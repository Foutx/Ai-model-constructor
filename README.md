
# 🚀 Machine Learning Regression & Classification with GUI

This repository contains a graphical interface tool for building and evaluating machine learning models. Using `RandomForest`, `Gradient Boosting`, and `Linear Regression`, you can train models for both regression and classification without writing a single line of code!

## 📌 Features

- 🎨 **Graphical Interface**: easy-to-use, no coding required
- 📊 **Regression**: RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, LinearRegression
- 🏷 **Classification**: RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier
- 📂 **Data Handling**: load and split datasets into train/test
- 🏆 **Metrics**: MSE, MAE, R2, F1-score, Accuracy, ROC AUC, and more
- 💾 **Model Saving** in `pickle` format
- 📈 **Graph Generation** for result analysis

## 📥 Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ⚡ Quick Start

1. Prepare a CSV file with your dataset
2. Define the target variable
3. Run `main.py`, and the interface will guide you through model selection and training

### 🖥 Using the Interface

Simply launch `main.py`, and an intuitive GUI will open, allowing you to:

- Select the model type (regression or classification)
- Configure algorithm parameters
- Load dataset files
- Train the model and view key metrics
- Save the results

## 🛠 Main Files

- `main.py` — main script with GUI functionality
- `regression.py` — library with models and data processing functions
